## (Software Engineering.intruiging === Box.intruiging) &#8594; TRUE

<p align="justify">  What would you say is the most intriguing object in the world? If you do a search in Google, the answer is “a container with a flat base and sides, typically square or rectangular and having a lid,” my answer is the box. While some may say that it is too simple, I argue that its simplicity makes it intriguing. The box has an abundant number of uses. While its primary use is to store things, it can also have unintentional additional functions. Also, it is the base concept of important structures in our lives like houses and portable technology. The box also has enormous potential for creativity because it is so simple. </p>
<p align="justify">  This same logic also applies to software engineering. The field is so broad that one person can not be a master in all aspects of software engineering. Its applications are endless and people would faint trying to keep track of all the different languages and software stacks. While companies of any size can build software, it is also possible for individual software engineers to develop their own. The difference in creativity inputted into each software can range through an entire spectrum. For instance, it can start from a simple user interface then evolve to a complex and beautiful system. As a result, the broadness of application and creativity of software engineering is what captivates me. </p>


## What do you need?

<p align="justify">  As I progress through this journey, I hope to develop the proper mindset and communication skills. Both of these skills are the bare necessity to succeed in this field. To illustrate, the mindset will stabilize an individual’s necessary skills to effectively accomplish the task by improving critical thinking and finding different solutions. Then, the communication skills further stabilize the entire process as interactions are required. Effective communication is needed when clarifying project requirements with clients and managing the progress with coworkers. These skills will help to minimize delays and experiences of overly complicated conversations with clients and coworkers.</p>

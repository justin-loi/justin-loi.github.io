<p align="justify"> As this semester comes to a close, I have come to find out that I have learned much more than my original expectation of the web application creation process. By going through a new module each week, my foundation has gradually stabilized. While I am nowhere near the pinnacle of any of these topics, my understanding is deep enough that I am more than just a lost lamb in the darkness. The topics I have learned the most is frameworks and coding standards.  </p>    

## Frameworks: The Template of Software Engineering

<p align="justify">The first naive thought when first learning about frameworks is “Can’t you do the same using raw HTML and CSS?”. The short answer is yes, but that is something very few professional developers do. Why? Frameworks are most valuable for consolidating the various required HTML and CSS to make an organized code in a relatively shorter amount of time. To illustrate, a couple of years ago, when I attempted to create a dropdown menu. In the end, it took hours to create my first dropdown menu using pure HTML and CSS. To make matters worse, it looked worse than a simple dropdown menu created in a matter of minutes in the Semantic UI Framework. Then to put the final nail in the coffin, I found out the code was so convoluted that I was unable to replicate it again. Overall, no matter the project, big or small, using frameworks will organize code and save time. </p>

<p align="justify">Within the field of software engineering, the relevance of frameworks is associated with efficiency. By the simple act of not using a framework, the minimum required time to build a project would increase exponentially. No matter which focus of software engineering, whether it is web development or something else, I will be on the lookout for frameworks that will help me complete my tasks more efficiently. </p>
<p align="justify">Outside of the software engineering niche, frameworks specifically do not have much value. However, the broad concept that frameworks represent, programs with the purpose to improve efficiency for the various tasks, is applicable throughout the various fields. In almost every field, technology has advanced enough that programs that aid in efficiency are available. The primary takeaway is to be aware of these resources and properly utilize them at the appropriate time. </p>

## Coding Standards: Trust Me, It will make your Life Easier

<p align="justify"> During my semester in software engineering, whether I wanted to or not, I learned to use ESLint. ESLint is a coding standard tool that detects and highlights warnings and errors in your code. To my surprise, I found out that ESLint also has the functionality to detect code with the same result but written differently. Afterward, the differently written code is conformed to use the implementation most commonly used in practical situations. In practice, ESLint is an annoying piece of work that still gets to me to this day. However, I would not be able to deny its functionality as it has proved its worth in group projects. To illustrate, the final project that I thought would be riddled with headaches and tears from the simple task of understanding everyone's code was surprisingly painless. ESLint laid the foundation that resulted in each person writing their code in the simplest terms.</p>
<p align="justify"> This broad concept is applicable in other fields of work. To illustrate, standards would also apply to a group of marketers. As the marketers spread the information about their product, it would likely conflict with each other without clear guidelines in place. Creating guidelines helps clear the confusion and effectively. In every case, a well-thought-out plan will always have a higher probability of creating a masterpiece than a combination of random ideas and prayers. </p>
<p align="justify"> In fact, I was able to experience the pain first-hand in another class. Unfortunately, I was assigned to write a response paper about a specific scientific study. While the assignment should have been relatively simple, it would be an understatement to consider it as the most annoying assignment of the semester. The simple act of writing the study as if it was spoken created the most arduous experience of the semester.  </p>

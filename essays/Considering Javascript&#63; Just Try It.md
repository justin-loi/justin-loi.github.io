## Javascript: Simple but Complex

<p align="justify"> Javascript is a fascinating programming language since it contradicted my initial thoughts. Compared to the other programming languages I have seen, Javascript was a relatively simpler and easier language to learn. The syntax and functions are incredibly lax, and numerous resources are available when it is required. For instance, variables and function parameters do not require their respective variable types. Also, shortening functions are possible in Javascript. While this is beneficial, these omissions can become counterproductive as the likelihood of errors increases. Besides, some of the new concepts that I have encountered, such as destructing objects or arrays, were syntactically simple, but that made it so confusing. </p>    

## Want to prove your Mastery&#63;

<p align="justify">  To test one's Javascript knowledge and efficiency, athletic software engineering is available. The practice Workouts of the Day (WOD) are especially beneficial because it provides some guidance when the starting point is unclear. Also, it helps with extracting and processing approaches for the tested concept in a timely fashion. However, this method is not, even the slightest, enjoyable. Since the task must be finished in a short amount of time, it creates a significant amount of pressure. </p>

## The Verdict

<p align="justify">  Overall, from a software engineering perspective, I would recommend Javascript as an excellent programming language to learn. While some of its lax syntaxes may confuse some, it is essential to note that no programming language is perfect. Also, once Javascript is mastered, its simplicity can be considered beneficial. Javascript can be easily applicable to a variety of situations, including practical scenarios. For instance, it is possible to use Javascript to develop an entire website. </p>

## Be Mentally Prepared

<p align="justify">To provide the straight truth, UI Frameworks is just as complicated and frustrating as a new programming language. UI Frameworks will be the boogeyman haunting new user’s dreams. The learning process is very simple, watching videos to attach new definitions to existing concepts. However, while learning the new additional definitions is not difficult, effectively applying them is a completely different task. It is like playing an elegant song on the piano with no music sheet. It is possible, but a lot of time and headaches are required to meet that goal. </p>
<p align="justify">I had the opportunity of learning Semantic UI, a UI Framework that focuses more on versatility than flashy looks. The learning process was relatively easy, which made me think that applying Semantic UI is like putting sprinkles on top of a cupcake. However, I could not have been more wrong because applying the concepts in an unguided setting is comparable to riding a bike without the training wheel for the first time. I made loads of educated guesses, some with satisfying results, but others drained my brain until it was fried.

## Don’t Fear and Jump in Headfirst

<p align="justify">As Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher said, “That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.” While learning and applying UI Frameworks is a lot of work, UI Frameworks shine the brightest when it helps programmers save time. Any element created in a UI Framework can be recreated using raw HTML and CSS. However, the amount of time and dedication required to achieve the same result is miles-long. As a result, learning a UI Framework will help decrease the amount of time spent on the front-end, which can be redirected towards other parts of the website. </p>

<p align="justify">In my case, at the end of my Semantic UI experience, I was satisfied with the result. To illustrate, the ease of overloading classes makes customizing layouts relatively simple. Also, Semantic UI’s simple design look enhances the charm of the website. Overall, even from the perspective of a programmer with one week of HTML/CSS experience and even less experience of Semantic UI, it is obvious to see that UI Frameworks is a key ingredient to make a presentable website in a relatively short amount of time.</p>

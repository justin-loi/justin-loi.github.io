## Overview

BowedIn is a web application designed to enable University of Hawaii students to connect with employers (fulltime and internships) easier. Allowing only University of Hawaii students and companies sign up and sign in, students are able to find available opportunities and connect the respective company. Either role is able to add interested positions or potential candidates (students and company, respectively) onto their respective home page. Finally, administrators are able to monitor the content posted on BowedIn. 

## Contributions

For BowedIn, my primary role was the development of the home pages for the three different roles: student, company, and admin. This includes the UI interface and the necessary subscriptions to the database. Some of the other minor contributions were the implementation of the add function in the potential hire list to render the respective student onto the company user's home page and making the page that would allow a company user to create a new position opportunity. 

## The Experience

Going through this project has been an enlightening experience that highlighted the accurate and inaccurate aspects of my preconceived basis of a group project. From the website aspect of the project, my foundation for HTML, Javascript, and CSS stabilized more. In addition, I got exposed and learnt more about the Semantic UI framework, Uniforms, Github, Testcafe, React, and MongoDB. From the planning aspect of the project, the experience of working was invaluable since it was my first group project. I was able to figure out which aspects of solo programming that would or would not work in a group setting through trial and error.
